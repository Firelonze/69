`-Kazuki, Akira and Yosai Sensei went towards a classroom that was kept free to have talks about the school Yosai Sensei ordered Akira to wait outside while him and Kazuki went inside-`

_Yosai Sensei:_ Kazuki take a seat.

`-Kazuki sits down at a chair near the table in the middle of the room-
`

_Yosai Sensei:_ Kazuki I have a few questions for you and some advice lets start with the questions alright.

_Kazuki:_ Alright Yosai Sensei what are the questions?

_Yosai Sensei:_ First question is what do you think about your classmates Kazuki.

_Kazuki:_ There are a few weird people in the class but I think they're nice so far.

_Yosai Sensei:_ Okay next question why do you think you're placed in 1S.

_Kazuki:_ I might have a theory.

_Yosai Sensei:_ And that is?

_Kazuki:_ My grandfather the man who caused millions of deaths and almost ruled this country.

_Yosai Sensei:_ You mean All For Ones right hand.

_Kazuki:_ How do you know?!

_Yosai Sensei:_ Kid calm down, everyone here knows it mainly because All might informed us cause what we thought was wrong but that's all he told us and you used the same summoning's as your grandfather used year ago.

_Kazuki:_ I knew I should've gone with my second quirk.

_Yosai Sensei:_ You mean your Time Quirk.

_Kazuki:_ Yes but lets carry on.

_Yosai Sensei:_ This last one is not really a question but something I need to inform you about, it's a rule for 1S only if someone from this school turns into a villain you and your classmates have to stop/arrest them understood.

_Kazuki:_ Yes sir and what was the advice.

_Yosai Sensei:_ Well my advice for you is that you stop attending at this school because if you turn villain I can stop you instead of you hurting all of your classmates.

_Kazuki:_ You want me to do what?!

_Yosai Sensei:_ You heard me right "Stop Attending This School" because it make things easier for people like you.

_Kazuki:_ No I won't Stop attending this school until I graduate from this school and an Official Pro Hero.

_Yosai Sensei:_ You're really stubborn you know that wel go to your class send Akira inside and send the next one on the list to the outside of the classroom.

`-Kazuki stands up from the chair leaves the room sends Akira in and sends Oni Towards the classroom-
`

`-Kazuki attended the rest of the classes with the rest in the class with people coming and going form and to the classroom where Yosai Sensei is-
`

`-Kazuki went towards home with Ako and he recognized someone on the way home-
`

_Kazuki:_ (Isn't that the guy who almost fell over his own foot by the entrance exams yeah it is him seems like he made it into UA)

_Kazuki:_ Hey Ako do you know that guy with the green hair?

_Seika:_ No Never seen him before why

_Seika:_ Why are you always doubting people?

_Kazuki:_ I'm not doubting you am I.

_Seika:_ No not me but seriously everyone else.

_Seika:_ If someone walks with you for almost 8 years in a row from your house to school and the other way around yes.

_Kazuki:_ Sorry.

_Kazuki:_ Alright.

`

`

_Yosai Sensei:_ Alright everyone today is just a regular school day and I have had all conversations with everyone so let's go through the lessons you'll get.

_Oni_ _{Whispers}:_ Kazuki psst.

`-Kazuki looks towards Oni-
`

_Oni {whispers}:_ Hey come talk in the lunch break I need to tell you something.

_Kazuki {Whispers}:_ Okay I will.

_Yosai Sensei:_ Be quiet both of you! Final warning.

`-Kazuki and Oni immediately payed attention to the rest of the less-
`

_Yosai Sensei:_ And last you need to choose a Class Rep I will let all of you decide who it will be by choosing someone and the one with the most votes will be class rep so that will be after lunch break, Don't forget tomorrow you all need your hero costumes.

`-Kazuki and Oni went to the Cafeteria together-
`

_Kazuki:_ So what did you want to talk about?

_Oni:_ It's kinda hard to explain but I just wanted to tell you about something that happens when I use my quirk.

_Kazuki:_ And that is?

_Oni:_ When I use my quirk I turn into a demon and because of that a Demon entity is stuck in my body.

_Kazuki:_ Where is this going?

_Oni:_ Well it doesn't listen to my orders when it has control and it keeps getting stronger so if it gets out of hand I want you the strongest of the class to stop me please.

_Kazuki:_ Seriously? You want me to stop you when you can't control it?

_Oni:_ Yes exactly that would you do that for me?

_Kazuki:_ Okay but if it happens I will talk to you first okay.

_Oni:_ Yes that's fine thank you Kazuki.

_Kazuki:_ Don't worry about it.
